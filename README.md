# Basic-Fetch-API

Heya!
This is something entirely new to me...
Fetching data from a local source ( in my case, it is the sample.txt file)
similar local source but a json file in 2nd case
extracting data from an external source (jsonplaeholder site) and more...

Am really thrilled to be able to complete it!
